# Railway Deployment Summary

## Changes Made for Railway Deployment

### 1. Configuration Files Added

- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway-specific deployment configuration
- ✅ `RAILWAY.md` - Deployment guide and instructions
- ✅ `.railwayignore` - Files to exclude from deployment
- ✅ `deploy-railway.sh` - Automated deployment script

### 2. Dockerfile Updates

- ✅ Added `curl` dependency for health checks
- ✅ Updated health check to use dynamic PORT environment variable
- ✅ Added copy commands for `instrument.js` and optional `gcs-key.json`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded PORT=3000 (Railway provides this dynamically)

### 3. Package.json Updates

- ✅ Added `@sentry/node` dependency
- ✅ Added `railway:start` script for Railway-specific startup

### 4. Sentry Configuration Updates

- ✅ Updated `instrument.js` to support Railway environment variables
- ✅ Added Railway deployment ID tracking for better error tracking
- ✅ Made Sentry DSN configurable via environment variable

### 5. Environment Variables to Set in Railway

```
NODE_ENV=production
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id (if using GCS)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name (if using GCS)
```

## Key Differences from Fly.io

1. **Port Management**: Railway provides PORT dynamically, no need to hardcode
2. **Health Checks**: Railway uses HTTP health checks on /health endpoint
3. **Storage**: Railway has ephemeral storage, external storage recommended for production
4. **Environment Variables**: Set via Railway dashboard or CLI
5. **Auto-scaling**: Railway handles this automatically

## Next Steps

1. Push code to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. Connect repository to Railway at https://railway.app
3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
4. Railway will automatically build and deploy using the Dockerfile

## Monitoring & Debugging

- Railway dashboard provides logs and metrics
- Sentry integration for error tracking
- Health endpoint: `/health`
- Memory monitoring via Railway dashboard

## Performance Optimizations for Railway

- DPI enforced at 200 for consistent memory usage
- Memory monitoring middleware included
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Compression middleware for reduced bandwidth
